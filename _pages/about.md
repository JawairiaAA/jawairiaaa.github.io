I am a hydrology enthusiast and Earth scientist. I study the terrestrial water cycle and the corresponding cryospheric and hydrologic conditions across water-stressed regions around the globe. My long term goal is to enhance the simulated connectivity between the hydrosphere and the anthroposphere by leveraging the latest advances in AI.

In the past, I explored data assimilation and applied machine learning to improve hydrologic modelling. Currently, I am focusing on developing frameworks that can integrate independent datastreams for reliable and accurate hydrologic state estimation.
