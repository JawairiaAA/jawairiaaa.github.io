Streamflow estimation across areas facing water scarcity is important considering the evolving climatic conditions. In this study, the impact of assimilating Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture retrievals on the modeled streamflow across three main river basins in South Asia is explored. Model estimated runoff was hydraulically routed using the HYMAP routing model within the NASA Land Information System (LIS) framework. Streamflow estimates via soil moisture assimilation highlighted the potential improvements in streamflow across low-flow river tributaries in irrigated regions. Limited relative change was noted along high-flow river tributaries. Modeled streamflow tended to underestimate the flow magnitude at upstream stations and overestimated the streamflow at downstream stations within the Indus basin due to missing physics related to reservoir operation. Improvement of the modeling systems represen-tativeness of the ground conditions by the inclusion of water management information would potentially improve the current streamflow modeling capability across South Asia.
