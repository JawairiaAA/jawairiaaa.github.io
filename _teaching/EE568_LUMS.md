The course covers the fundamental principles of remote sensing of the environment. Contemporary remote sensing techniques, software, and datasets are discussed. Geographic and hydrometeorologic datasets are used to study the application of the electromagnetic theory to retrieve information about the Earthâ€™s system via satellite constellations. The course is designed to help students develop a broad understanding of the importance of remote sensing in comprehending and monitoring our environment. The remote-sensing skills gained through this course can be easily applied to other fields as well.
